        EvryDay - Every day

        EvryWorkgDay - Every working day

        IntrvlDay - An interval specified in number of calendar days (02 to 31)

        IntrvlWkDay - An interval specified in weeks (01 to 09), and the day
        within the week (01 to 07)

        WkInMnthDay - A monthly interval, specifying the week of the month (01
        to 05) and day within the week (01 to 07)

        IntrvlMnthDay - An interval specified in months (between 01 to 06, 12,
        24), specifying the day within the month (-05 to -01, 01 to 31)

        QtrDay - Quarterly (either ENGLISH, SCOTTISH, or RECEIVED)

        ENGLISH = Paid on the 25th March, 24th June, 29th September and 25th
        December.

        SCOTTISH = Paid on the 2nd February, 15th May, 1st August and 11th
        November.

        RECEIVED = Paid on the 20th March, 19th June, 24th September and 20th
        December.

        For transaction entries subject to availability/float and for which
        availability information is provided, the value date must not be used.
        In this case the availability component identifies the number of
        availability days. All dates in the JSON payloads are represented in ISO
        8601 date-time format.
