# Open Banking Developer Portal

These APIs are currently unavailable for TPPs to use. To be informed about when they are available, please email openbanking-support@zopa.com. We recommend using a team email address over an individual contact.

## Open Banking

The Zopa Open Banking API is based on the Open Banking Standard which allows regulated Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access Account Information Services (AIS).

Access to these services on behalf of members is controlled by strong customer authentication within Zopa apps as part of OpenID Connect authorisation flows.

We are a registered Account Servicing Payment Service Provider (ASPSP) who provide access to these services based on the Open Banking standard.
